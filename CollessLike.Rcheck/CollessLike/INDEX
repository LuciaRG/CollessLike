CollessLike-package     Methods to compute distribution and percentile
                        of balance indices of phylogenetic trees
a.g.model               Generates a random tree
balance.indices         Computes 3 balance index of a tree
colless.like.index      Computes the Colless-like index of a tree
cophen.index            Computes the cophenetic index of a tree
distribution            Computes the percentile in the alpha-gamma
                        distribution of the indices of the given tree
indices.simulation      Generates random trees and computes their
                        balance indices
sackin.index            Computes the Sackin index of a tree
